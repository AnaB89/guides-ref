A Value List is a powerful data modeling feature which, at design-time models a particular list of values, which may be static, or dynamic, data-driven lists. Value lists may be bound to UI components, as well as interacted with programmatically. At run-time, a value list returns a list of dynamically generated values for the context of a form/foundset. When bound to a UI component, a value list is displayed as a list of choices, i.e. in a combobox or radio button group, etc. Value lists obviate the need to write code and SQL, thus greatly enhancing developer productivity.
